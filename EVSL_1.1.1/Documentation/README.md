The EVSL documentation is done using Doxygen.

One can compile the documentation offline by running `make docs` in EVSL_1.1.x.

The LaTeX PDF documentation can be generated by running `make latex` in EVSL_1.1.x/Documentation

Alternatively, an online version of the documentation can be viewed

A handbook paper was written, which is available as `Handbook.pdf`, or from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05215), which, should you wish to cite it, can be cited as follows:
```
