This  directory  contains  drivers  for testing  a  few  routines  for
computing eigenvalues of a sparse (symmetric real) matrix pair (A, B),
where B is assumed to be positive definite.

All drivers read the matrices A and B in matrix market format from a file
(matfile) -- see below for details. There are 4 drivers provided.

MMPLanN.c Pol. filtering Lanczos algorithm with no restarts
	  uses Lanczos for slicing. 
 	  ** Note: this driver tests the case when all operations with
	  B are performed by a polynomial approximation - so no factorization 
	  is required.

MMPLanR.c Pol. filtering Lanczos algorithm with restarts
	  uses KPM for slicing

MMRLanN.c Rational filtering Lanczos algorithm with no restarts
	  uses Lanczos for slicing

MMRLanR.c Rational filtering Lanczos algorithm with no restarts
	  uses KPM for slicing

Drivers  that use  alternate spectrum  slicing for  each of  the above
drivers are  included in the  EXTRAS sub-directory. These  can replace
the corresponding  ones provided above if  the user wants to  test say
KPM vs. Lanczos for spectrum  slicing (e.g., KPM_MMRLanN.c will is the
same as MMRLanN.c above except that it uses KPM instead of Lanczos for
spectrum slicing).
